# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game
A basic Tic-Tac-Toe game in which two players alternate turns placing X or O on a 3x3 board. The winner is the first to get three in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Basic game logic, input checking, and easy-to-use interface. Great for studying game development and honing coding skills.
